# Linked Open Statistics — Paris Hackathon #
### 10 September 2018 - 14 September 2018

These pages give information about the LOS hackathon that will take place in Paris in September 2018.

## General information

The hackathon is organized in the framework of the [Linked Open Statistics ESSnet](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/cros/content/linked-open-statistics_en). Its main objectives are to:
  * Develop programs to create or enrich RDF statistical datasets;
  * Create RDF links between those datasets and other data;
  * Develop programs that use the datasets in a valuable way (query, explore, visualize, export, etc.);
  * Evaluate or test software packages that perform all or part of the previous activities.

The hackathon is structured in two tracks:
  * The “Produce” track will focus on creating, linking, and otherwise enriching RDF data sets.
  * The “Consume” track will be devoted to using the RDF data sets by building tools to visualize, query, explore, import or export them.

For more information on these two tracks, click on the following links: [Produce](tracks/produce-track.md) - [Consume](tracks/consume-track.md).

## Practical information
